			With the Elo-rating Module you can organise ongoing tournaments in a club, school, company ... 
			You can use it for every type of game that's played between two opponents: chess, football, snooker ... 

			Every game played adds/subtracts points to a player's Elo-rating depending on the Elo-rating of his/hers oponent.
			The more games are played, the more acurate the ratings become.
			
			The basic install is suited voor chess, checkers, go ... every game that uses 'black' and 'white'.
			By adjusting the Locale/Translations you can change this to any game (f.e. Player 1 en Player 2).
