Fork CMS Module - Elo-rating
==========================

Imagine you're playing some game (chess, pool, football ...) regularly at your company, school, neighbourhood ... and you want to keep score of who's the best, without having to organise knock-out tournaments (which is a hassle).
 
Comes in: ***The Elo-rating Module for Fork CMS***

## What's inside?
* Backend actions for organizing your players and games
* Automated calculation of the Elo-ratings
* Three frontend actions (Ranking, Players en Games)
* Four frontend widgets (Top Ranking, Number of Games played, Latest Game and Add a Game)
* Support for English and Dutch
