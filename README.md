Fork CMS Module - Elo-rating
==========================

Imagine you're playing some game (chess, pool, football ...) regularly at your company, school, neighbourhood ... and you want to keep score of who's the best, without having to organise knock-out tournaments (which is a hassle).
 
Comes in: ***The Elo-rating Module for Fork CMS***

## What's inside?
* Backend actions for organising your players and games
* Automated calculation of the Elo-ratings
* Three frontend actions (Ranking, Players en Games)
* Two frontend widgets (Top Ranking and Games Played)
* Support for English and Dutch
