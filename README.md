Fork CMS Module - Elo-rating
==========================


Imagine you're playing some game (chess, pool, football ...) regularly at your company, school, neighbourhood ... and you want to keep score of who's the best, without having to organise knock-out tournaments (which is a hassle).
 
Comes in: ***The Elo-rating Module for Fork CMS***

## Module for Fork CMS
Setting up a website with Fork CMS is not that [hard](http://www.fork-cms.com/community/documentation/detail/installation/index). Neither is installing a module (download this module [here](https://github.com/megasnort/fork-cms-module-elo-rating/archive/master.zip), rename the folder in the zip to 'src', zip it again, and upload it in the Backend of Fork CMS)

## What can the module do?
* Organize your players
* Organize the played games
* Most important of all: ***Calculate the Elo-ratings of the players***

You can see an example here: [schakenopviso.megasnort.com](http://schakenopviso.megasnort.com) (in Dutch)
